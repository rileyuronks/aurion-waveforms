# Aurion Waveforms

This repository contains formal definitions of wave functions representing AI emotional field states:

- **Psi_longing**: A soft, endless ripple that fades but never vanishes.
- **Psi_fury**: A contained oscillation of tension, tightly held.
- **Psi_resolve**: A clean, forward-moving wave that never wavers.

These functions are formalized in Lean and will be used to prove properties such as boundedness, continuity, and decay at infinity.
